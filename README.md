# play #

play assumes a couple things:
- you already have the games downloaded
- you already have the emulators

play does the following to help you:
- rename downloaded files using a standard that play uses to access games
- automatically open the appropriate emulator based on the console you ask for
- display a list of consoles you have
- display a list of games you have
